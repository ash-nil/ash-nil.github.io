# Toliza Museum of Art

## Current Expensing Structure 

The Toliza Museum of Art is in the process of reviewing its performance
from 2008 when it ran at a deficit in three well-received special
exhibits. This deficit impacted the museum's finances as a whole,
producing a deficit of almost $1 million rather than the budgeted
surplus of just over $2.5 million, as seen in Exhibit 1. This is
particularly concerning since the museum sold more admission tickets
than anticipated, and also garnered $2 million more in admission fees
than expected, as seen in Exhibit 2. While there was a decrease in the
average price of each ticket, museum admissions saw an increase of 25%
in the actual number of admissions sold as compared to the budgeted
number. The increase in quantity of sales more than made up for the
decreased price. However, part of the surplus/deficit issue is
illuminated by Exhibit 3 which shows that the curatorial staff expenses
also saw changes in both pricing and number of hours between what was
budgeted and what was actually used. However, although the actual hourly
rate was on average $1 less than budgeted, the number of actual hours
used were severely increased by almost 30%. Due to this, the actual
expenses for the curatorial staff were over $500k more than budgeted.

## Options for Improving Profitability

### Option 1: Change the Discounted Rate

Although budgeted expenses are vastly different than actual, we do have
the option to simply bring in more money through admissions to offset
the increased expenses. Discounted admissions are one third of the price
of standard admission, but account for almost half the total admissions.
Although increasing the price of discounted admissions will necessitate
a decrease in users of that admission rate, Exhibit 4 shows that
increasing the price to $10 will vastly improve the profitability of
museum admissions, even with a decrease of 10% in discounted admission
sales. However, this ability to bring in additional funds through
adjusting admissions rates does not solve the mystery of the increase in
expenses. That's where Activity Based Costing comes in.

### Option 2: Use Activity Based Costing

For activity-based costing, we have direct costs allocated to regular
and special exhibits, along with added allocations for curatorial and
security activities which do not have direct cost comparatives (Exhibit
5). While there is not a direct cost associated with each exhibit type
for curatorial and security activities, those expense pools can be
calculated using the average hourly rate for each employee type and the
actual hours used for each exhibit type. Exhibit 6 shows the expenses
associated with each exhibit type for direct, curatorial, and security
costs. With that, it's clear that the regular exhibits do have an
increased expense as compared to special exhibits. However, the revenue
brought in for each exhibit type, also in Exhibit 6, demonstrate that
regular exhibits are operating at a profit of almost $2 million while
the special exhibits are operating at a deficit of over $2.5 million.

## Recommendation

Recommendations for making the museum more profitable are two-fold. To
start with, I would recommend the museum adjust the price of discounted
admission as the increase in revenue will more than offset the decrease
in the number of admission tickets sold for that rate. That will provide
a stop-gap solution, however the solution will be a temporary one unless
the increase in expenses is accounted for. As such, my secondary
recommendation would be to thoroughly analyze the profitability of
special exhibits as compared to their expense to ensure increased
profits are not negated by equally increased expenditures.
