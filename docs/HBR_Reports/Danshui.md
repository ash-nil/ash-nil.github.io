# Danshui Plant 2

## Problem at Hand

The Danushi Plant 2 is being used to manufacture and ship the new iPhone
4. However, this plant has never manufactured phones before -- it was
setup originally for computer manufacturing and so the factory workers
do not have a strong background in the manufacturing processes for
phones. Due to that, along with some manufacturing issues, the plant is
producing and shipping on average about 20k fewer phones per month than
budgeted. Alongside the reduction in production, some expected costs
were increased -- specifically labor expenses, supervision, and one of
the required chips. Additionally, the anticipated revenue transfer was
decreased. Exhibit 1, the preliminary report for August 2010, shows
these issues and has the factory running at a monthly deficit of just
over 600k versus the anticipated profit of 100k. Leadership at this
factory needs to evaluate the budget to understand the authenticity of
the deficit, and to determine what can be done to ensure continued
profitability.

## Analysis Summary

Though exhibit 1 is technically accurate, it is much like comparing
apples to oranges. Many of the budgeted expenses, and the budgeted
revenue, have changed. As such, we need to take a deeper look into the
actual impact of these changes in expenses. Most of the fixed costs
(rent, utilities, etc.) remain static between the anticipated and actual
budget, with the exception of supervision. However, Exhibit 2 shows the
budgeted per-unit production expenses of each phone as compared to the
actual per-unit costs (derived from the details the actual expenses of
exhibit 1). This exhibit demonstrated that even with the increase in
labor and chip costs, other decreases more than made up the difference
and the actual per-unit production rate is almost $0.50 less than
budgeted.

With that adjustment, we can then use Exhibit 3 to see the breakeven
point on the original budget with a 200k production versus the actual
costs and revenue with 180k monthly production. This exhibit shows that
when using actual costs, the number of units required to break even is
almost 60k fewer than required using the budgeted numbers, and the
needed revenue to break even is almost $13mil less than required for
the original budget. Overall, the original report, which tried to
compare a budget for 200k unit production to an actual budget for a
plant that's producing 180k units monthly, skews the expense report in
such a way that the plant appears less profitable than it is in reality.
This is extra apparent when we review exhibit 4 which compares the
budgeted per-unit and fixed costs to the actual per-unit and fixed costs
on an expected 180k production. Had Danushi planned for a 180k unit
production vs a 200k production, the total costs would have been
immediately apparent.

## Recommended Next Steps

The first step this plant needs to take is to accept the fact that due
to the unfamiliar production process, Danushi Plant 2 will set its
budget on a 180k monthly unit production, rather than 200k monthly
production. Provided that sets the standard, the plant will simply by
default get a more accurate picture of its profitability. One other
recommendation would be to consider moving labor expenses into an ABC
costing method. Since each unit goes through over 100 steps in the labor
process and is touched by over 300 people, that is a lot of nuanced
costing information being missed in the bulk "assembly and packaging"
line item. It is likely that supervision should also be included in the
ABC costing method for labor, since those two tasks are intrinsically
tied together. With these changes, Danushi Plant 2 should have a better
picture of its profitability.
